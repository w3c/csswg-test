W3C CSS Test Suite Repository
-----------------------------
 
approved/ is for tests that have been reviewed and approved.
Approved tests are managed as a common resource.
Do not touch anything here unless you are a test suite Owner
or Peer, or have permission from one and know what you are doing.

contributors/ contains a directory for each test suite contributor.
Tests inside a contributor's directory are managed by that contributor.
Do not touch anything outside your own directory unless you have
permission from the directory's owner or from a test suite Owner
or Peer.

tools/ is random scripts that may be useful when administering tests.
 
Contributing
-------------

Absolutely everyone is welcome (and even encouraged) to contribute to test
development, so long as you fulfill the contribution requirements detailed
in the [Contributing Guidelines][contributing]. No test is too small or too
simple, especially if it corresponds to something for which you've noted an
interoperability bug in a browser.
